Each club has an identity, style and agenda of its own. Students could choose to be a member of any one or a group of clubs, pursue activities of interest and hone their skills. These activities under the guidance of the experienced people provide a proper channel for creative thinking and also act as safety release for bottled up emotions.
To inculcate discipline right from the childhood, activities like NCC, Scouts and Guides are also included in the regimen that train the students to be prepared for serving the nation at times of need.</p>
